# fantasia

A 3D renderer I decided to write as a practice project.

**WARNING: NOT SUITABLE TO BE ACTUALLY USED!!**

## Testing fantasia out:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aliencdh/fantasia
cd fantasia
cargo run --release
```

This will create an `output.tga` file. If you can't open it, try installing [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/)
